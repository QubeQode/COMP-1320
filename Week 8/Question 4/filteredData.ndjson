I bought this for my iPhone 4s, and unfortunately, it doesn't stay on. It comes in two pieces, one white piece that snugly fits on the bottom, and the pink drip portion that slides over the white piece. It's the pink piece that makes this unfortunate. It doesn't click with the white piece at all, and it easily slides off. I wanted so much to keep this case on, but I also didn't wanna risk my phone having a giant crack on the screen due to a case that doesn't stay on. For the price, it is neat, but I really doubt I'm going to keep it on my phone.
