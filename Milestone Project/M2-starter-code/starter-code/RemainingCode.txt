As of now updateFeed runs before updateDatabase and so retrieves the image before updateDatabase has
a chance to add the new img to array. updateFeed needs to wait for updateDatabase to complete before
running.

Also updateFeed returns promise pending object so something about the return statement is not valid.

Once updateFeed returns the filepath as intended:
    - filepath is passed in as the src of the img
    - img is appended as child of 'gallery-item'
    - second div is made with class 'gallery-item-info'
    - secon div is appended as child of 'gallery-item'

After this the websocket functionality should be complete.
