Real-time photo feed:
- New images appear without a browser refresh
- Right now we must refresh bc the browser and server aren't communicating
    - http connection ends once request and response have been achieved
    - browser must initiate request in order for server to respond
- We must find a way for the server to communicate w the browser without browser initiating


Long-Polling: NOT RECOMMENDED
- 90s to early 2000s

setInterval(() => {
    //some function
}, 2000)

- Trigger a get request w/ function to /feed so it updates every 2 seconds
- Problem is it is very inefficient
- Also every get request will refresh the page
    - User's browser will refresh every 2 seconds


AJAX: ALSO NOT RECOMMENDED 
    - Allows you to send request to server and recieving response with no refresh
    - fetch() in Js is a function that lets you do this
    - This solves the refresh but not the process occurring every 2 seconds


Websocket: RECOMMENDED OPTION
- Smarter version of http
- Browser and server form a permanent connection
- Whenever server wants it can just send data through connection
- No page refresh

How to Approach Websocket:
- Look at NPM websocket library
    - Powerful
    - Very complex
- Look at NPM ws library
    - Positives: easier to work with
- Look at socket.IO
    - Easiest solution
    - Start with this and then move to ws or websocket

Server will send just the image via websocket. Need to dynamically create img tag using js in our
html page.
