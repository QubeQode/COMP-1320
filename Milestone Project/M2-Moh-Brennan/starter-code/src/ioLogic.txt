With singleton-like function getInstance circumvents circular dependancy. Socket is no longer 
limited to being referenced in index.js

uploadImage logic will use .then to call: 

socket.on('newImage', (inputID) => {
        var imagePath = updateFeed(inputID);
        io.emit('newImage', imagePath);
});

after updateDatabase has completed. 

updateFeed's returned value is passed into io.emit block and emitted to all clients

feed.ejs will contain a socket that:

- listens for the 'newImage' event emitted by server side logic

- creates div class='gallery-item'
- creates img with src= the imagePath variable being emitted [appendChild 'gallery-item']
- creates div class='gallery-item-info' [appendChild 'gallery-item']

- creates ul [appendChild 'gallery-item-info']

- creates li class='gallery-item-likes' [appendChild 'ul']
- creates span class='visually hidden' [appendChild 'gallery-item-likes']
- creates span.innerHTML 'Likes:'
- creates i class='fas fa-heart' aria-hidden='true' [appendChild 'gallery-item-likes']
- creates li.innerHTML '56' [placeholder for some future logic]

- creates li class='gallery-item-comments' [appendChild 'ul']
- creates span class='visually hidden' [appendChild 'gallery-item-comments']
- creates span.innerHTML 'Comments:'
- creates i class='fas fa-comment' aria-hidden='true' [appendChild 'gallery-item-comments']
- creates li.innerHTML '2' [placeholder for some future logic]

- Recreates the atomic css structure for a gallery-item
- Updates user's feed in real time to display the image just uploaded by matching user, via 
  appendChild js logic

Stopping Point: Console logging within the script block in feed.ejs outputs nothing in the browser
                console (or the IDE console either). My best guess is that the socket.on block isn't
                being activated by the 'newImage' event. My working theory as to why this is the
                case is that io.emit isn't actually emitting the 'newImage' event. However finding a
                means to debug socket.io has been challenging.
